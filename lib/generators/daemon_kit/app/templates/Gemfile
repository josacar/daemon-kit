# If you need to 'vendor your gems' for deploying your daemons, bundler is a
# great option. Update this Gemfile with any additional dependencies and run
# 'bundle install' to get them all installed. Daemon-kit's capistrano
# deployment will ensure that the bundle required by your daemon is properly
# installed.
